				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Darren Hayes</strong> is best known for his time as <strong>Savage Garden</strong>&#8216;s frontman from 1993 to 2001. But when the group abruptly dissolved, he continued his career as a solo singer. Although Savage Garden was a total blast and their popularity rocketed beyond their own expectations, Darren didn&#8217;t quite benefit from it. He chose a different musical path and that was a clear departure from Savage Garden&#8217;s sound. The lyrics and vocal style didn&#8217;t change, but Darren went frenzy with electronic sounds that were too far from the poppy rock his fans were used to.<span id="more-859"></span></p>
<p>He published a few albums with major labels, but then in 2007 he made something bold, and in my opinion, the best work of his life. He self-produced an album called &#8220;This delicate thing we&#8217;ve made&#8221;. As a follower of his work, I myself didn&#8217;t know he was working on it till it was published, and even then it took some time for me to find out there was new material. I was totally blown away by this whole album, but if I have to choose one song, this is it: &#8220;Step into the light&#8221;. There&#8217;s something magic about it, poignant, deep&#8230; It&#8217;s not necessarily the lyrics, although maybe that too. It&#8217;s the whole composition, the vibe, Darren&#8217;s voice, a bit of everything. It&#8217;s not the deepest track in the album at all, but the song really lingered on me and I still have it on my playlist.</p>
<p>The album didn&#8217;t do too well, unfortunately, and there were comparisons with <strong>Madonna</strong> or <strong>Kate Bush</strong>. Who cares, I loved it! And I loved it even more after reading the journey to create it (read the story <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/darren-hayes-justin-shave" target="_blank">here</a>), and the old vintage hardware/software used to produce it.</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is, my favourite piece. Let me know what you think!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife&#8217;s cousin is a woman of traditions. One of them is to sing a particular song during each family reunion: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7KI_lMnvt4" target="_blank">El Peregrino</a>. It&#8217;s that kind of thing everyone knows will happen at some point of the party. And if she doesn&#8217;t start singing on her own, eventually people will demand that she does it (in a friendly but firm way, of course!). Anyway, when she came to Barcelona to visit us and meet our newborn son, we were playing around with an App that auto-tunes not-so-good singing skills&#8230; and we ended up producing this parody video:</p>

<p>Oh yeah!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have just learnt that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/07/bloomberg-fitbit-pebble-acquisition/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000602" target="_blank">Fitbit is acquiring Pebble</a> and phasing out its devices, including my dear <strong>Pebble Time</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a year using this watch, my first smartwatch, and I have to say I am sad to hear the news. I decided to go for Pebble because I didn&#8217;t have to charge the watch each day, its battery lasts way longer than any competitors&#8217; models. But I ended up loving it by its simplicity, because it&#8217;s cute and fun, and most of all, because it&#8217;s useful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I will buy another smartwatch, I&#8217;ll continue using my poor orphan Pebble until it dies completely, if that ever happens (I guess it will at some point).</p>
<p>I want to thank the indie smartwatch maker for this year, I have enjoyed their product, and I hope Pebble&#8217;s founders and employees can all find a new job soon, if Fitbit does not hire them. Well done, guys.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pebble is dead&#8230; Long live the Pebble!</p></blockquote>
