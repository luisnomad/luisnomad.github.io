				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I am a Software Developer. I have been coding professionally since 2000, but I started much earlier. At some point during my career, I moved to Front-End development because I enjoy the pretty side of programming, make stuff move, and so on. In other words, I like the immediate satisfaction of seeing my code come to life, I like the visual part of it.</p>
<p>So it made perfect sense to explore other was of creating visual works, starting with photography. I eventually discovered video production, and that blew my mind. I have worked in several self-founded projects, mostly documentaries and food-porn videos.</p>
<p>This video puts all that fun into images. It&#8217;s a really silly clip, but it shows really well why I love doing what I do.</p>
